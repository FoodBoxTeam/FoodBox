Once you login you will see this page. Make sure to select the 'Click here to confirm you account' link at the top. Again it won't make you confirm it on the email you put in, but it wouln't let you log back in if you don't select that

# Payment
Although this website's goal is to be professional and ready to be put on the market, we do not have any physcial products, nor do we have any way of charging you. So when you see a form to put your information, DO NOT PUT IN SENSITIVE IMFORMATION. We are practicing going through the process (including recording the data you give us) but will not be billing anyone or sending out products to anyone either.

# Why log in?
You can see your order history, change your favorite orders/items and when you refresh the page/leave/go to a diffrent computer, your order will still be there!
